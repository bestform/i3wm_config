i3wm Config
===========

Additional software used:

`feh` for the screen background

`vifm` as file manager

`arandr` for setting up multi monitor setup (you won't need this if you are only using one monitor)


Multi Monitor Setup
-------------------

I use `arandr` to setup my monitors and save it to `~/.screenlayout/layout.sh`. This i3 config will load it, if it is present.


Keyboard Layout
---------------

The keyboard layout defaults to `en` and can be switched to `de` using `alt+shift`
